  description: Managed Service Registry cloud.redhat.com API Management API that lets
    you create new registry instances. Registry is a datastore for standard event
    schemas and API designs. Service Registry enables developers to manage and share
    the structure of their data using a REST interface. For example, client applications
    can dynamically push or pull the latest updates to or from the registry without
    needing to redeploy. Registry is an Managed version of upstream project called
    Apicurio Registry. Apicurio Registry also enables developers to create rules that
    govern how registry content can evolve over time. For example, this includes rules
    for content validation and version compatibility.

          Specifies the order by criteria. The syntax of this parameter is
          similar to the syntax of the _order by_ clause of an SQL statement.
          Each query can be ordered by any of the kafkaRequests fields.
          For example, in order to retrieve all kafkas ordered by their name:

          ```sql
          name asc
          ```

          Or in order to retrieve all kafkas ordered by their name _and_ created date:

          ```sql
          name asc, created_at asc
          ```

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then
          the results will be ordered by name.
        examples:
          orderBy:
            value: name asc
        explode: true
        in: query
        name: orderBy
        required: false
        schema:
          type: string
        style: form
      - description: |
          Search criteria.

          The syntax of this parameter is similar to the syntax of the _where_ clause of an
          SQL statement. Allowed fields in the search are: cloud_provider, name, owner, region and status. Allowed comparators are `<>`, `=` or `LIKE`.
          Allowed joins are `AND` and `OR`, however there is a limit of max 10 joins in the search query.

          Examples:

          To retrieve kafka request with name equal `my-kafka` and region equal `aws`, the value should be:

          ```
          name = my-kafka and cloud_provider = aws
          ```

          To retrieve kafka request with its name starting with `my`, the value should be:

          ```
          name like my%25
          ```

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then all the kafkas
          that the user has permission to see will be returned.

          Note. If the query is invalid, an error will be returned
        examples:
          search:
            value: name = my-kafka and cloud_provider = aws
        explode: true
        in: query
